## Overview

A high-performance, visually immersive website for **Lumora Solar Private Limited** — a solar EPC (Engineering, Procurement & Construction) company operating across India. Built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no build tools — yet delivers an experience on par with React-based production sites.

The site communicates Lumora Solar's core offering: transparent pricing, certified installation, government subsidy guidance, and a track record of 35+ MW across residential, commercial, industrial, and institutional clients.

## Features

### 3D Interactive Hero
- Real-time **Three.js** scene with a procedurally generated solar panel mesh and an animated sun with soft sprite-based radial glow
- Particle field with over 100 floating nodes reacting to scroll position
- Smooth camera orbit animation on load

### Cinematic Sections
- **Solar video section** with a full-viewport background video, GSAP parallax overlay, and attention-catching headline typography
- **Silk WebGL backgrounds** — an animated generative silk canvas runs behind Why Go Solar, Solar Systems, Projects, and FAQ sections
- **Preloader** with three conic-gradient orbital arc rings that spin and dissolve into the hero

### Scroll Animations (GSAP + ScrollTrigger)
- Reveal-on-scroll for every card, section header, and content block
- **5-Step Process bar** is scroll-coordinated in real time via a CSS custom property `--lp` driven by `scrub: 0.35` — the progress line fills and steps activate exactly as you scroll
- Counter animation on the hero stats (27+, 35+, 90%)
- Savings comparison bar animates in when it enters the viewport

### Contact Form (Web3Forms)
- Serverless form submission via **Web3Forms** — no backend required, no server costs
- Fields: name, phone, email, installation type (dropdown), monthly bill, message
- On success: confirmation message with the user's name
- On failure: graceful fallback to a **pre-filled WhatsApp message** so the lead is never lost
- Node.js + Express + Nodemailer backend also included in `server.js` for teams that prefer self-hosted email delivery

### Infinite Project Carousel
- 15 real completed projects displayed in a horizontally draggable 3D card grid
- Auto-drifts continuously — drag to jump, release to resume
- Cards show project capacity, location, and scope on hover

### Pricing & Subsidy
- 6 solar system pricing cards (1 kWp → 10 kWp) with accurate India market pricing
- PM Surya Ghar Yojana subsidy table with central + state breakdown
- Highlight card for the best-value tier

### SEO — Production Grade
- Optimised `<title>` and `<meta description>` targeting 13 high-intent India solar keywords
- **Open Graph** + **Twitter Card** meta tags with a custom-generated 1200×630 social preview image
- **JSON-LD structured data** — `Organization`, `LocalBusiness`, `FAQPage`, and `Service` schemas for Google Rich Results
- `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`
- `loading="lazy"` on all below-fold images
- All third-party scripts (`Three.js`, `GSAP`) loaded with `defer` to eliminate render-blocking

### Responsive & Accessible
- Fully mobile-responsive from 320px up
- Hamburger navigation with smooth open/close
- `aria-label` on interactive controls
- Semantic HTML5 landmark elements (`<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`)
